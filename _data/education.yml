    During my time at AITS, I learnt most of my key skills such as self-learning, teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time in the Institute and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    I spent a lot of my free time as a volenteer and event organizer for *EEE Deaprtment*.
