    During my time at AITS, I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as selflearning, teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time in the Institute and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    I spent a lot of my free time as a volentter and organizer for *EEE Deaprtment*.
